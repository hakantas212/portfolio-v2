    <h1>Hi there.</h1>
    <Span>
      Since earning my degree in Mobile Creative from Hyper Island and
      Changemaker Education Front-end Development, I have been working as a
      creative designer/developer in a dynamic fast paced digital marketing
      environment. My background includes designing and developing user
      friendly, responsive websites, apps and HTML5 banners - along with skills
      and ability to collaborate effectively with clients and team members I
      believe that the result will be to produce high quality deliverables.

      Practical innovation, group dynamics and productive team collaboration are
      fundamentals of team success for me. Iâ€™m passionate about remaining
      up-to-date with web technologies, usability and UI design while I also
      enjoy hiking, traveling and being photography enthusiast.
